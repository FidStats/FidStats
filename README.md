- 👋 Hi, I’m @FidStats
- 👀 I’m interested in data, its quality, analysis and visualisation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R itself (done a few quick coureses on dplyr, ggplot, tidyverse).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on graphs, varied analysis and improving my coding.
- 📫 How to reach me is by this forum but also I have a twitter account, so follow if you'd like: FidStats
